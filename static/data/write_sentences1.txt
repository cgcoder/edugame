Chicken is a bird.
Chicken lives in a farm.
Cow gives us milk.
You can use maps to go from one place to other.
Cars have four wheels.
I go to school every day.
We live on planet Earth.
Sun is a star.
I love playing in the park.
I would like to learn how to swim.
How old are you?
What color do you like?
Could you start working on your home work?
Would you help me fetch the ball?
